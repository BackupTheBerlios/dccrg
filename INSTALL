The grid itself is only two .hpp files so installation consists of
just putting them somewhere where your compiler can find them.

When compiling your program the Zoltan library and boost serialization
and mpi libraries must be included into the compilation command, for example
with: -lboost_mpi -lboost_serialization -lzoltan
See the Makefile in the examples directory for an example.

Naturally (Open or some other) MPI, Zoltan, boost serialization and
mpi libraries must be installed. If this:
http://dccrg.berlios.de/installation.html
website doesn't help, refer to the libraries' websites (or your
distributions documentation) for installation instructions:
www.open-mpi.org
www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/
www.boost.org
