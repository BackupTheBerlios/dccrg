The grid itself is only a single .hpp file so installation consists of
just putting the dccrg.hpp file somewhere where your compiler can find it.

When compiling your program the Zoltan library and boost serialization
and mpi libraries must be included into the compilation command, for example
with: -lboost_mpi-mt -lboost_serialization-mt -lzoltan
See the Makefile in the examples directory for an example.

Naturally OpenMPI, Zoltan and boost serialization and mpi libraries must
be installed, refer to their websites (or your distributions documentation)
for installation instructions:
www.open-mpi.org
www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/
www.boost.org
